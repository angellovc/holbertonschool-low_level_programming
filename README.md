# Low Level Foundations

This is a Low Level Foundations repository created to learn the main principies behind low level programming, master the logical skills in coding and convert it into a guide to others students or developers.

## About The Project
**What is a Low Level Programming Language**

When we talk about low level language we are refearing to language with low abstraction which is meaning, in other words, that it is more like a machine languages than human languages. That is important to having in account because machines just understands binary number so that mean the less abstraction a language have, the harder is to be understanded for humans.

**What is C**

C is a Low Level Programming Language Created by Dennis Ritchie.

**Why C**

Today there are a lot of languages which easy the developers life being very similar to english language, like Python, Dart, Javascript and others. But that does not make C deprecated, C today is very important in our life, because is the language in which our S.O are developed, the majory of the security systems are built on it and our robots use it because of his efficiency.

Why you would want to learn C even if your not interested in low level? No matter the area in which you want to work, as developer, C will give you a better understanding about how the memory works and what is happening on behind of high leve languanges like python or javascript. 


## Instalation
This programs and functions might be compiled with ***gcc 4.8.4*** using the flags ***-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic***
